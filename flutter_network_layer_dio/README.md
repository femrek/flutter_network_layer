## General Information

This is an API request layer for Dart/Flutter projects.

- The flow of the usage of this package:
    - Create your `ResponseModel`'s to define the type of the response. (`GetTodoResponse` is the example in the
      following class diagram)
    - Create your `RequestCommand`'s to define the properties of the request. (e.g. method, url path, headers, payload,
      etc.) (`GetTodoRequestCommand` and `PostTodoRequestCommand` are the examples in the following class diagram)
    - Create your `INetworkInvoker` object from an implementation of this package. (`DioNetworkInvoker`). Using
      `get_it` is highly recommended to create a singleton instance of the `INetworkInvoker`.
    - In business logic, create a `RequestCommand` object and send it to the `INetworkInvoker` object to get the
      response.

### Command Pattern Like Request Management

This package uses an architecture that is similar to the command pattern to manage requests.

Each request is a command that can be executed as a parameter of the `request` method of the `INetworkInvoker`
interface.

Request commands can be created by implementing the `RequestCommand` class. The `RequestCommand` class has fields that
describes the request such as http request method (GET, POST, etc.), request header, payload, etc. The request is sent
to the server by executing the `request` method of the `INetworkInvoker`.

### Implementation with Dio

[Dio][pd_dio] is a powerful HTTP client for Dart/Flutter projects. This package provides an implementation of the
`INetworkInvoker` interface with Dio named `DioNetworkInvoker`.

## Features

- Modular and easily pluggable architecture.
- Command-pattern-like request management.
- Easy integration with dependency injection frameworks like `get_it`.
- Logging trigger function to integrate with logger of the product level.

## Use in Your Project

**Tests:**
The tests in the `test` directory demonstrates how to use the network layer. Also, the `example` application is a simple
Dart program that uses this package to fetch data from a server.

**Example Project:**
[example_flutter_dio][gh_example_flutter_dio] is a good example that shows how to use `flutter_network_layer_dio` in a
Flutter project. This example also includes `get_it` to create a singleton instance of the `INetworkInvoker` with the
`DioNetworkInvoker`implementation. As logger, `logger` package is used in this example and `onLog` function of the
`DioNetworkInvoker` is set to receive logs from this package.

Follow the steps below to use the network layer in your Dart/Flutter project:

- Add the network module as a dependency in the `pubspec.yaml` file of the project.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_network_layer_dio: <version code> # check the version code in the pubspec.yaml file of the module.
```

- Create your own response models like following example. Also, you can use auto generation tools like
  `json_serializable` to generate these models. The only point is that these models should implement the
  `JsonResponseModel` or `CustomResponseModel` and providing valid serialization methods.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_network_layer_dio/flutter_network_layer_dio.dart';

final class ResponseUser extends JsonResponseModel {
  const ResponseUser({
    required this.id,
    required this.name,
    required this.age,
  });

  const ResponseUser.empty()
      : id = '',
        name = '',
        age = 0;

  final String id;
  final String name;
  final int age;

  @override
  ResponseUser fromJson(dynamic json) {
    assert(json is Map<String, dynamic>, 'json is not a Map<String, dynamic>');
    final map = json as Map<String, dynamic>;

    return ResponseUser(
      id: map['id'] as String,
      name: map['name'] as String,
      age: map['age'] as int,
    );
  }

  @override
  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() {
    return {
      'id': id,
      'name': name,
      'age': age,
    };
  }
}
```

- Create your own request models (commands) like following example. This class have to include information about the
  request will be sent to the server.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_network_layer_dio/flutter_network_layer_dio.dart';

final class RequestUser extends RequestCommand<ResponseUser> {
  @override
  Map<String, dynamic> get data => const {};

  @override
  Map<String, dynamic> get headers => const {};

  @override
  HttpRequestMethod get method => HttpRequestMethod.get;

  @override
  OnProgressCallback? onReceiveProgressUpdate;

  @override
  OnProgressCallback? onSendProgressUpdate;

  @override
  String get path => '/user';

  @override
  RequestPayloadType get payloadType => RequestPayloadType.json;

  @override
  ResponseUser get sampleModel => const ResponseUser.empty();
}
```

- Finally, you can use the network invoker named `DioNetworkInvoker` to send the request to the server. The following
  example demonstrates how to send a request to the server and handle the response.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_network_layer_dio/flutter_network_layer_dio.dart';

import 'request_user.dart';
import 'response_user.dart';

void main() async {
  final INetworkInvoker nm = DioNetworkInvoker();
  final RequestCommand<ResponseUser> request = await nm.request(RequestUser());
  request.when(
    success: (response) {
      print('Response: $response');
    },
    failure: (error) {
      print('Error: $error');
    },
  );
}
```

## Listen the Logs of the Package

The package provides a logging trigger function to integrate with the logger of the product level. The logging trigger
function can be set by calling the `setLoggingTrigger` function of the `NetworkModule` class.

```dart
// pass the logging trigger function when creating the network invoker.
final INetworkInvoker nm = DioNetworkInvoker(
  onLog: _onLog,
);

void _onLog(LogLevel level, String message) {
  // You can use your own logger here.
  // For a simple example, you can print the logs to the console like that.
  print('[$level] $message');

  if (!level.maySensitiveData) {
    // The log message does not contain request or response data for this condition.
  }
}
```

## Dio Interceptors

Dio interceptors can be added to the network invoker by passing them as a parameter to the constructor of the
`DioNetworkInvoker` class. They are added to the Dio instance when the `init` method is called. Check the Dio
documentation for more information about interceptors.

```dart

final INetworkInvoker nm = DioNetworkInvoker(
  dioInterceptors: [
    YourInterceptor(),
  ],
);
```
